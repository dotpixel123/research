////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
INSTALLATION/COMPILATION

The KEWPIE2 program requires prior installation of the latest version of the GSL library:
- UNIX environment: gsl-1.16.tar.gz, can be downloaded from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
- Make sure that PATH contains the link to the GSL library with *.h files.
- To complie the code, please use Makefile, which can be modified by the user.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

After successful compilation, just type "make run" in the terminal to run the program.
- Modifying the input file in the folder "Input/" (see below for more details) 
- The output file can be found in the folder "Results".

The above instructions also work for the MAC environment.
